  <p class="sm-text">Let me tell you my story, I'm a 22 year old engineering student who have been trying to learn programming since he was 14, and mostly stumbled a lot along the way. I've always been fascinated by computers, those strange white things -  that's how they looked back then -  and what they can do, but mostly I didn't know a damn thing about how they work, and never thought that one day it would be my career to write software for them.</p>

  <p class="sm-text">will pretty damn hard if you don’t know what you’re doing, and this is mostly my case, so it’s going to be more of a learning experience, than actually writing a framework, it would take ages for me to finish, or even understand the basics needed for such an attempt, but what the hell I’m going to try it anyway.</p>
