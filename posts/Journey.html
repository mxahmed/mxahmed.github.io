	   <h3>Chapter One: The adventure begins</h3>
<p>OK I’m going to build a simple web framework, How hard can it be?</p>
<p>will pretty damn hard if you don’t know what you’re doing, and this is mostly my case, so it’s going to be more of a learning experience, than actually writing a framework, it would take ages for me to finish, or even understand the basics needed for such an attempt, but what the hell I’m going to try it anyway.</p>
<p>First step would be to research in some specific topics, there’s tons of things I need to learn, HTTP, WSGI, and a lot more that needs to be fully understand and in depth, also I’ll need to learn from frameworks that already exist in the python ecosystem, this means I’ll have to dig my teeth into the code of one of this frameworks if not more, this is going to be even more exciting for me than writing my own dummy framework. [ yaa this shit is exciting ]</p>
<p>I forgot to mention that the language I’ll be using is python as it’s the language I’m most familiar with, and the one most suitable for me to use. The first framework that comes to mind when talking about web frameworks for python is Django, it’s the one I’m mostly familiar with, but to dive into the code of such a beast is an attempt that no one should take lightly, trust me I’ve tried, it’s a rabbit hole you don’t wanna go down, and If you did you might not come back. [ I’m no Alice after all ]</p>
<p>The framework which I decided to choose for studying is Flask, it’s usually praised by python web developers as a small framework that you can get you’re head around it’s code base easily and in a relative short time, also I like most of the concepts flask uses and how it address some problems with simple yet effective solutions, and it’s built around a WSGI wrapper “Werkzeug” that I might end up using myself, if I’m not going to build my own. [ WSGI is a pain in the ass ]</p>
<p>Also I might look into other frameworks such as bottle, web2py and web.py, this last one is a very simple framework that was built by Aaron Swartz, this alone would make me look into it even so it might be a little out dated. [ fun fact, it was used to rewrite reddit from lisp to python]</p>
<p>In the next post I’ll document what I’ve come up with diving into the topics of HTTP, WSGI [ Web Server Gateway Interface ] and other things I need to know. [ hope I come out of it alive ].</p>
