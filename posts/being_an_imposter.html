       <h2>Being an Imposter</h2>
       <p class="datetime">June, 09 2018</p>
       <div class="post">
	   <p>Let me tell you my story, I'm a 22 year old engineering student who have been trying to learn programming since he was 14, and mostly stumbled a lot along the way.
I've always been fascinated by computers, those strange white things -  that's how they looked back then -  and what they can do, but mostly I didn't know a damn thing about how they work, and never thought that one day it would be my career to write software for them.
It all started one summer when I was staying at one of my relatives house, and he had a friend visiting him, coincidentally his friend was a software programmer <strong><em>they weren't called software engineers back then</em></strong> and he started to talk about what he does.</p>
<p>I was only 14 years old and didn't understand a word of what he said, but only one sentence caught my attention, He said, "Programmers are the best users of computers, If you want to fully control a computer you should learn to program",
It sounded more dramatic the way he said it in arabic, or it might be that i was young and excited about what he said, But I was literally hooked.</p>
<p>Fast forward, I'm 18 It's my last year at high school and i'm still fascinated by computers and programming, still haven't learnt that much about the two topics but i've written some small little programs and had fun doing it.
I finished high school, got into some trouble with our education system, And wasn't able to enter the collage that I wanted to go to - the faculty of computer and information - 
but I had the chance to go to some institution for two years and study engineering after it, so why not let's try it then.</p>
<p>That's where I meet a new friend that was also fascinated by computers and programming, it was a very nice thing, to find someone who shares your interests, And he was much better at it than I was.
We started working together on some little projects of our own, that was when this thoughts started coming to me.</p>
<p><strong>I'M NO GOOD, I WILL NEVER GET BETTER AT THIS</strong>
<strong>HE WILL FIND OUT THAT I CAN'T CODE</strong></p>
<p>Those thought kept coming to me each time we worked together on something, and each time I wrote some code that didn't work, or had trouble understanding the code he wrote.</p>
<p><strong>I CAN'T DO IT, I DON'T KNOW HOW</strong></p>
<p>I was struggling with this thoughts while I tried to learn new things and new programming languages and concepts, and in those two years I didn't improve that much,
I still don't Know How a computer Works - the software part of it at least -, And I'm Not a good programmer That was what I kept telling myself.</p>
<p>The two years ended and I was able to enter the faculty of engineering at Mansoura university, where I meet some extraordinary people that shared the same passion I have for computers and programming - shout out to CAT Reloaded - </p>
<p>A year later I joined CAT Reloaded, and started participating with them in the activities that the team organizes , I even got a training opportunity at a software solutions company as a Backend Web developer thanks to team members.
But still that feeling of incompetence and the thought that they will find out that i'm a fraud or an imposter kept coming back to me.</p>
<p>If you have experienced that feeling before, or something similar to it, then you know what i mean.</p>
<p>And one day at the company a colleague of mine approached me, and said that the people there think I'm very good at what I do, and that I have a very good chance of getting a job at the company after I finish the training, that's strange but I'm not that good, I kept thinking.</p>
<p>Could it be that i'm taking my skills lightly, am I really a good programmer.</p>
<p>After that talk with this colleague who is now a friend, I started to think that, maybe I have a problem, I started thinking of what might that problem be, and one day while diving from one search result to another I came across the term Imposter Syndrome, And this article on Medium How I Fight Imposter Syndrome</p>
<p>I found out that I really had a problem and that it had a name, but what was most relieving is that I wasn't the only one that had this problem, Actually It Is a very common problem in the field of computer science and software engineering, or any other field that requires any creativity.</p>
<p>The definition according to wikipedia:
"<strong><em>Impostor syndrome</em></strong> (also known as impostor phenomenon or fraud syndrome) is a term coined in 1978 by clinical psychologists Dr. Pauline R. Clance and Suzanne A. Imes referring to high-achieving individuals marked by an inability to internalize their accomplishments and a persistent fear of being exposed as a "fraud". Despite external evidence of their competence, those exhibiting the syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have achieved. Proof of success is dismissed as luck, timing, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent and competent than they believe themselves to be. Some studies suggest that impostor syndrome is particularly common among high-achieving women."</p>
<p>Ok, now that I know my problem, what can I do to get rid of it, putting the psychological bullshit that I found in lots of articles aside.
the answer to that was, I will probably never get rid of it, that feeling is here to stay, and maybe I will always think that I'm not a good programmer.
But also there's a great chance that I will get better at recognizing the feeling when it comes to me and that I'll be able to control it, that has already started to happen.</p>
<p>I can see now that it is not a problem anymore, I can always use it as something to drive me to get better and sharpen my skills,
So my advice to you is, when ever you get those feelings of incompetence or that you are not really good at what you do, or that you will never be able to learn more or be a good programmer, designer, artist or anything else that you want to be.</p>
<p>You should stop those feelings and thoughts in their track, and Just remember that they are deceiving you, And that all of us feel that way most of the time when ever we get faced by something new that we need to learn, or something that's currently out of the reach of our skills.</p>
<p>It's not an easy thing to do though, it's like everything else that is worth doing, it takes time and effort, you just need to try and stop that Imposter.</p>
<p>If you expected a full advice with steps to take to the path of enlightenment as they say, then you were wrong, I've just found out that I have problem and I'm still figuring it out.</p>
<p>But i just wanted you to know that you're not alone in this.</p>
