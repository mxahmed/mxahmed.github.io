       <h2>Being an Imposter</h2>
       <p class="datetime">June, 09 2018</p>
       <div class="post">
	   <p>Let me tell you a story, I’m a 22 year old Egyptian engineering student who has been trying to learn programming since he was 14, and mostly stumbled a lot along the way.
I’ve always been fascinated by computers and what they can do, but mostly didn’t know a damn thing about how they work, and never thought that one day it would be my career to write programs and work mainly with computers.</p>
<p>It all started one summer when I met a friend of my cousin who was a programmer — they weren’t called software engineers back then — and he started to talk about what he does, actually I didn’t understand most of what he was saying, Only one sentence caught my attention,</p>
<p><strong><em>“Programmers are the best users of computers, If you want to fully control a computer you should learn to program”</em></strong></p>
<p>It sounded more dramatic the way he said it, or it might be that I was young and excited about what he said, But I was literally hooked.</p>
<p>Fast forward, I’m 18 It’s my last year at high school and I'm still fascinated by computers and programming, still haven’t learned that much about the two but written some small little programs and had fun doing it, I finished high school, got into some trouble with our education system, And instead of going to college went to an institution that gives you the opportunity to study engineering after it, there I met a new friend who was also fascinated by computers and programming as I was, it was a very nice thing, to find someone who shares your interests, And He was much better at it than I was.</p>
<p>We started working together on some little projects of our own, that was when these thoughts started coming to me.</p>
<p><strong>I’M NO GOOD, I WILL NEVER GET BETTER AT THIS
HE WILL FIND OUT THAT I CAN’T CODE</strong></p>
<p>Those thoughts kept coming to me each time we worked together on something, and each time I wrote some code that didn’t work, or had trouble understanding the code he wrote.</p>
<p><strong>I CAN’T DO IT, I DON’T KNOW HOW</strong></p>
<p>I was struggling with these thoughts while I tried to learn new things and new programming languages and concepts, I’m not improving enough, I still don’t Know How a computer Works — the software part of it at least-, And I’m Not a good programmer, That was what I kept telling myself.
Two years went by and I was able to enter the faculty of engineering at Mansoura university, where I met some extraordinary people that shared the same passion I have for computers and programming — shout out to CAT Reloaded —</p>
<p>A year later I joined CAT Reloaded, and started participating with them in the activities that the team organises , I even got a training opportunity at a software company as a Backend Web developer thanks to team members, But still that feeling of incompetence and the thought that they will find out that I'm a fraud or an impostor kept coming back to me, If you have experienced that feeling before, or something similar to it, then you know what I mean.</p>
<p>One day at the company a colleague of mine approached me, and said that the people there think I’m very good at what I do, and that I have a very good chance of getting a job at the company after finishing the training, that’s strange but I’m not that good, I kept thinking.</p>
<p>Could it be that I'm taking my skills lightly, am I really a good programmer ?!!</p>
<p>After that talk with this colleague who is now a friend, I started to think that, maybe I have a problem, I started thinking of what might that problem be, and one day while diving from one search result to another I came across the term Impostor Syndrome, And this article on Medium How I Fight Impostor Syndrome, I found out that I really had a problem and that it had a name, but what was most relieving is that I wasn’t the only one that had this problem, Actually It’s a very common problem in the field of computer science and software engineering, or any other field that requires any creativity.</p>
<p>The definition according to Wikipedia:</p>
<p><strong><em>“Impostor syndrome (also known as impostor phenomenon or fraud syndrome) is a term coined in 1978 by clinical psychologists Dr. Pauline R. Clance and Suzanne A. Imes referring to high-achieving individuals marked by an inability to internalize their accomplishments and a persistent fear of being exposed as a “fraud”. Despite external evidence of their competence, those exhibiting the syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have achieved. Proof of success is dismissed as luck, timing, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent and competent than they believe themselves to be. Some studies suggest that impostor syndrome is particularly common among high-achieving women.”</em></strong></p>
<p>OK, now that I know my problem, what can I do to get rid of it, putting the psychological crap that I found in lots of articles aside, the answer to that was, I will probably never get rid of it, that feeling is here to stay, and maybe I will always think that I’m not a good programmer., But also there’s a great chance that I will get better at recognising the feeling when it comes to me and that I’ll be able to control it, that has already started to happen.</p>
<p>I can always use it as something to drive me to get better and sharpen my skills,</p>
<p>So my advice to you is, when ever you get those feelings of incompetence or that you are not really good at what you do, or that you will never be able to learn more or be a good programmer, designer, artist or anything else that you want to be, You should stop those feelings and thoughts in their track, and Just remember that they are deceiving you, And that a lot of us feel that way most of the time whenever we get faced by something new that we need to learn, or something that’s currently out of the reach of our skills.</p>
<p>It’s not an easy thing to do though, it’s like everything else that is worth doing, it takes time and effort, you just need to try and stop that Impostor.</p>
<p>If you expected a full advice with steps to take to the path of enlightenment as they say, then you were wrong, I’ve just found out that I have problem and I’m still figuring it out.</p>
<p>But I just wanted you to know that you’re not alone in this.</p>
<p><em>Many thanks to my best friend -who doesn’t want her name mentioned- for reviewing this, my first post on medium and the encouragement by her to post it.</em></p>
